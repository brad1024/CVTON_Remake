# C-VTON: Context-Driven Image-Based Virtual Try-On Network

[[paper pdf]](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/papers/Fele_C-VTON_Context-Driven_Image-Based_Virtual_Try-On_Network_WACV_2022_paper.pdf)

### Abstract

Image-based virtual try-on techniques have shown great promise for enhancing the user-experience and improving customer satisfaction on fashion-oriented e-commerce platforms. However, existing techniques are currently still limited in the quality of the try-on results they are able to produce from input images of diverse characteristics. In this work, we propose a Context-Driven Virtual Try-On Network (C-VTON) that addresses these limitations and convincingly transfers selected clothing items to the target subjects even under challenging pose configurations and in the presence
of self-occlusions. At the core of the C-VTON pipeline are: (i) a geometric matching procedure that efficiently aligns the target clothing with the pose of the person in the input images, and (ii) a powerful image generator that utilizes various types of contextual information when synthesizing
the final try-on result. C-VTON is evaluated in rigorous experiments on the VITON and MPV datasets and in comparison to state-of-the-art techniques from the literature. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to produce photo-realistic and visually convincing results and
significantly improves on the existing state-of-the-art.

## Requirements

- Python (3.8.10)
- opencv-python (4.5.1.48)
- torch (1.7.1+cu110)
- torchvision (0.8.2+cu110)
- lpips (0.1.4)
- matplotlib (3.3.4)
- pandas (1.2.0)

The experiments were conducted on one (for image resolutions 256×192) or two (for image resolution 512×368) NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPUs.

## Testing

To avoid setting up this repository only to obtain results presented in the paper, please see the generated test results [here](https://unilj-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/ajda_lampe_fri1_uni-lj_si/EUGuq5g2GsVMhr8-SJaJzOsBAv3eV2u5lYHNaVs48jg5rQ?e=rM89CX) (for VITON), [here](https://unilj-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/ajda_lampe_fri1_uni-lj_si/EaNy6fTn9J5Ko9gN07CP-JkB99pOlQFzCPCg-YALheCoKA?e=vxYgKm) (for VITON-HD) and [here](https://unilj-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/ajda_lampe_fri1_uni-lj_si/EaMvf74Mr79AqNexNF3dsLQBJ7gT2xj0Hu5hoHeCLGTdFg?e=RY3V1n) (for MPV). You can find respective test splits alongside provided preprocessed data [here](https://unilj-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/ajda_lampe_fri1_uni-lj_si/ETp4oU8UlJJJmLcAeHe7AAQB8guB7DXsWnrvz1X6wXVhYA?e=fKMFay) (VITON) and [here](https://unilj-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/ajda_lampe_fri1_uni-lj_si/EQAaPs8M7BpIlQoTiqKse8wBL0gX8IbXP74jKxg35hNrGw?e=geHFmv) (MPV).

Running tests yourself requires some setting up to do:
* Install requirements.
* For VITON / VITON-HD: 
    * Download [our preprocessed data](https://unilj-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/ajda_lampe_fri1_uni-lj_si/ETp4oU8UlJJJmLcAeHe7AAQB8guB7DXsWnrvz1X6wXVhYA?e=fKMFay) and extract them to folder `./data/`. Since we are not allowed to share the actual dataset, contact the authors of the [original VITON paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/html/Han_VITON_An_Image-Based_CVPR_2018_paper.html), ask them for the full-resolution dataset and download it to appropriate folders.
* For MPV:
    * Download [our preprocessed data](https://unilj-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/ajda_lampe_fri1_uni-lj_si/EQAaPs8M7BpIlQoTiqKse8wBL0gX8IbXP74jKxg35hNrGw?e=geHFmv) and extract them to folder `./data/`. Additionally, obtain the version of the MPV dataset *in resolution 256×192* and extract it alongside preprocessed data.
* Download pretrained BPGM model for [VITON / VITON-HD](https://unilj-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/ajda_lampe_fri1_uni-lj_si/EZnNGs6iKTtFuO6d5RXKnSkBFqd1gTepsuOJx4jcwUxU0w?e=AsCnp8) or [MPV](https://unilj-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/ajda_lampe_fri1_uni-lj_si/Edg4zAN2GFxHqFFJqCCL330BTWn8QjD2_AETPFQn-Uy43Q?e=ukbkOO) and put it in `./bpgm/checkpoints`.
* Download pretrained C-VTON model for [VITON](https://unilj-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/ajda_lampe_fri1_uni-lj_si/ETmsytfF7uBPns6JUWBbQWQBWA13txw3TIt7iKhdx0NHXg?e=sZduTp), [VITON-HD](https://unilj-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/ajda_lampe_fri1_uni-lj_si/EYTs9svs9I1Hm-SJ0nvxWacB4Zwh1ExyXbq4rU1Elky3-g?e=OxA2If) or [MPV](https://unilj-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/ajda_lampe_fri1_uni-lj_si/EWhBbsGC7V5MtxAKbDh6M5MBnpX2H_kgpSDGzppFv_c7ew?e=DxwV3B) and put it in `./checkpoints`.
* Run test scripts:
```bash
cd C-VTON
./scripts/test_{dataset}.sh
```

Make sure you use our test split to obtain the same results.

## Training

To train the models from scratch, download all data mentioned in previous section and install requirements. Then, similarly to testing, run appropriate scripts from the `scripts` folder:
```bash
cd C-VTON
./scripts/train_{dataset}.sh
```

When training using VITON-HD dataset make sure to delete the second line in `train.py` in order to use all available GPUs.
